     Cybersecurity is the practice of keeping systems, networks, and data safe from attacks or unauthorized access.
     It is what protects people from hackers who may try to steal information, spread viruses, or disrupt services.  
     In simple terms, cybersecurity is like building a strong lock and wall around your digital world — your phone, laptop, bank apps, or even social media.  
     Without cybersecurity, private information could be exposed, accounts could be taken over, or systems could stop working.  


     Would you like me to expand this using a Call of Duty Mobile (CODM) example? 🎮

  utter_accept_cybersecurity:
  - text: |
     In a Call of Duty Mobile (CODM) match: your teammates represent your personal data and devices, while enemies can be seen as hackers who are trying to take them out.  
     The OP player (most skilled player) on your team takes the role of cybersecurity — setting traps, blocking enemy fire, and watching every angle to keep everyone safe.  
     Without that defender, the team would be vulnerable and could lose quickly. But with strong defense, the whole team survives and keeps playing.  
     That’s exactly what cybersecurity does in real life — it defends your digital world so your information and systems stay protected.

  utter_principles:
  - text: |
       The fundamental principles of cybersecurity are built around the **CIA** triad:  

       **C**- Confidentiality: making sure information is only seen by the right people.  
       **I**- Integrity: ensuring the information remains correct and unchanged by others.  
       **A**- Availability: keeping systems and information accessible when needed.  

       Would you like me to give you a CODM example for better understanding? 🎮
       
       👉 Type **F** for Example. If you don’t want it, just type **no**.

  utter_accept2_principles:
  - text: |
       🎮Confidentiality in CODM, is like turning on your mic only for your teammates when planning a strategy.  
        That way, enemies or outsiders can’t hear your plans.  

        🎮Integrity in CODM, is like recording what you and your teammates discussed during the match.  
        If someone tries to twist your words, you can always prove exactly what was said.  

        🎮Availability in CODM, this is like making sure your sensitivity settings or game controls are always available and working.  
        You can also share them with teammates.  
        By storing these settings in the cloud, you can access them anytime from any device.
        ✅ Just like these CODM strategies protect your team, the CIA principles in cybersecurity protect information from being exposed, altered, or lost.

  utter_encryption: 
  - text: |
      **🔐Encryption** 
      is the process of converting information into a secret code so that only people with the right key can read it.  

      Imagine you write a message in plain English — anyone can read it.  
      But if you scramble it using encryption, it turns into unreadable text that looks like random symbols.  
      To make sense of it again, the receiver needs the correct key to “unlock” the message.  

      This is very important in cybersecurity because it protects sensitive data like passwords, bank details, or private messages from being stolen or exposed.  
      ✅ Without encryption, anyone who gets hold of your data can read it. With encryption, even if attackers steal it, it remains useless without the key.  
      

      Would you like me to give you a CODM example for better understanding? 🎮
      👉 Type **E** for Example. If you don’t want it, just type **no**.

  utter_accept3_encryption:
  - text: |
      🎮 Awesome! Let’s look at **Encryption** in CODM terms.  

      In CODM, when you turn on your mic and set it to “team only,” your voice is restricted to your teammates.  
      The game makes sure that whatever you say is sent securely, almost like it’s being **encrypted**.  
      Outsiders, enemies, or random players cannot hear your strategy — only your squad can.  

      Even if someone tries to tap into the communication, all they would get is noise without the right “key” to unlock your voice data.  

      ✅ Just like in cybersecurity, encryption protects sensitive information. 
      It ensures only the intended people (your teammates) can understand the message, while others are locked out.

  utter_hashing:
  - text: |
      **🔐Hashing**
      is the process of taking any information—like a password or message—and converting it into a fixed-length string of characters that looks like random symbols 🔢🌀.

      Imagine your password is "codemaster123". Hashing scrambles it into something like "a8b9c1d2e3f4..." that **cannot easily be turned back** into the original password 🔒❌.

      This is very important in cybersecurity because it protects sensitive data 🛡️💾.  
      ✅ Even if attackers see the hash, they **cannot figure out your original password** easily 👀🚫.

      Would you like me to give you a CODM example for better understanding? 🎮  
      👉 Type **H** for Example. If you don’t want it, just type **no** ✋.

  utter_accept4_hashing:
  - text: |
     🎮 **CODM Scenario: Hashing**
     When you log in to CODM, your password isn’t stored as plain text. Instead, it’s saved as a **hash** 🔐🌀.  

     This means even if someone hacks the game’s server, they **cannot transform it back** into your original password 🔒❌.  

     Imagine you’ve just leveled up and earned 500 XP 🏆. Your account info, including your password, is safe because hashing keeps it secure 🛡️💾.  

     ✅ Thanks to hashing, you can enjoy the game without worrying about hackers stealing your login details 👀🚫.

      👉Type **Y** for Yes or **N** for No.

  utter_authentication:
  - text: |
      🛡️ **Authentication** 
      is the process of verifying that someone is really who they claim to be 🔍✅.  

      When you log in to a system or game, authentication checks your identity before giving you access 🔑.  

      This is very important in cybersecurity because it **prevents unauthorized people from accessing your account or data** 🚫💾.  
      ✅ Without authentication, anyone could pretend to be you and steal your information.  

      Would you like me to give you a CODM example for better understanding? 🎮  
      👉 Type **A** for Example. If you don’t want it, just type **no** ✋.
  
  utter_accept5_authentication:
  - text: |
      🎮 **CODM Scenario: Authentication**  
      When playing CODM, your teammates have a **label on their head** 🏷️, showing that they are your allies.  

      Only those with this label are recognized as teammates ✅, while everyone else is treated as the enemy 🚫💀.  

      This is similar to authentication in cybersecurity: the system verifies who is allowed in and who is not 🛡️💻.  
      ✅ Thanks to authentication, you can safely play without worrying about impostors sneaking into your team. 

  utter_authorization:
  - text: |
      🗝️ **Authorization**  
      is the process of determining what a verified user is **allowed to do** in a system 🔓📋.  

      After authentication confirms your identity, authorization decides your **permissions and access levels** ✅.  

      This is very important in cybersecurity because it ensures users **can only access the resources they are allowed to** 🚫💾.  
      ✅ Without proper authorization, someone might see or modify data they shouldn’t.  

      Would you like me to give you a CODM example for better understanding? 🎮  
      👉 Type **Z** for Example. If you don’t want it, just type **no** ✋.

  utter_accept6_authorization:
  - text: |
      🎮**CODM Scenario: Authorization**  
      Imagine you are playing CODM. Only players that have the **teammate tag** 🏷️ above their head can access the information you share through the mic 🎤✅.  

      Even if someone logs in with a valid account but **doesn’t have the tag**, they **cannot hear your voice or access your shared info** 🚫👂.  

      ✅ This is like authorization in cybersecurity: it makes sure users can only access what they are **allowed to see or use** 🛡️💻.

  utter_backup:
  - text: |
      💾**Backup**  
      is the process of making a copy of your important data so it can be restored if something goes wrong 🛡️📂.  

      Backups are very important in cybersecurity because they **protect your information from loss** due to accidents, hacks, or device failure ⚠️💻.  
      ✅ Without backups, losing your data can be permanent.  

      Would you like me to give you a CODM example for better understanding? 🎮  
      👉 Type **L** for Example. If you don’t want it, just type **no** ✋

  utter_accept7_backup:
  - text: |
      🎮**CODM Scenario: Backup**  
      Hey, when you link your CODM account to Google or Activision 🌐, your **settings, sensitivity, and controls** are automatically backed up in the cloud ☁️🎮.  

      This means if you switch to a new phone or device 📱💻, you can **access your account exactly how you left it**, without losing progress ✅.  

      ✅ Just like in cybersecurity, backups keep your data safe and **accessible from anywhere** 🛡️💾.
